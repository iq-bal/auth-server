### **Authentication vs Authorization**

1. **Authentication**:

   - **Definition**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that the entity attempting to access a system or service is who they claim to be.
   - **Examples**: Logging in with a username and password, biometric scans (fingerprint, facial recognition), etc.
   - **Outcome**: If successful, the user is **authenticated** and recognized by the system.

2. **Authorization**:
   - **Definition**: The process of determining what resources or actions a user is permitted to access or perform after they have been authenticated.
   - **Purpose**: Controls access to resources based on the user’s permissions or roles.
   - **Examples**: Access control lists (ACLs), role-based access control (RBAC), determining whether a user can access certain files, perform an action (like `create`, `read`, `update`, or `delete`), etc.
   - **Outcome**: If authorized, the user can proceed with their intended action or access the requested resource.

### **Key Differences**:

- **Authentication** answers the question: **"Who are you?"**
- **Authorization** answers the question: **"What are you allowed to do?"**

### **What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?**

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is an open standard (`RFC 7519`) used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for **authentication** and **authorization** purposes in modern web applications.

#### **Structure of a JWT**:

A JWT is composed of three parts:

1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing (e.g., `HS256`) and the type of token (`JWT`).
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims, or the actual data being transmitted. These claims are typically the user information (e.g., user ID, roles, etc.).
3. **Signature**: Ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with. It is generated by encoding the header and payload using a secret key or private key.

A typical JWT looks like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

### **JWT Workflow: Authentication and Authorization**

**A diagram depicting JWT architecture (on right)**

#### **1. User Login and Token Issuance**

- **User Action**: The user sends their login credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication server via a POST request.

  ```http
  POST /login HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "password": "mypassword"
  }
  ```

- **Server Validation**: The server checks if the credentials are correct.

- **JWT Creation**: If valid, the server **generates a JWT** containing the user’s information (such as user ID and roles) in the payload. The server **signs the token** using a secret key.

  Example of a **JWT Payload**:

  ```json
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "admin",
    "iat": 1516239022
  }
  ```

  **Generated JWT** (Header.Payload.Signature):

  ```
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
  ```

- **Response to Client**: The server sends the generated JWT back to the client.

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "token": "<jwt_token_here>"
  }
  ```

---

#### **2. Client Stores the JWT**

- The client (browser or mobile app) stores the JWT. Common storage options include:
  - **Local storage** (`localStorage` in browsers).
  - **Cookies** (for web apps).
  - **Memory** (for short-lived tokens).

---

#### **3. Making Authenticated Requests**

- For every subsequent request to a **protected resource**, the client sends the JWT along with the request, usually in the `Authorization` header.
  ```http
  GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token_here>
  ```

---

#### **4. Server Validates the JWT**

- **Decoding the Token**: The server receives the JWT and extracts its **header**, **payload**, and **signature**.
- **Signature Validation**: The server uses the **same secret key** (or a public key, for asymmetric encryption) to **validate the token's signature**. If the signature doesn’t match, the token is rejected.
- **Expiry Check**: The server checks the `iat` (issued at) and `exp` (expiry) claims to ensure the token is still valid.

  Example Payload with Expiry Claim:

  ```json
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "admin",
    "iat": 1516239022,
    "exp": 1516242622
  }
  ```

---

#### **5. Granting or Denying Access**

- **If Valid**: The server grants access to the requested resource.
- **If Invalid** (e.g., token expired or tampered with): The server sends a `401 Unauthorized` response.

#### **Use of JWT in Authorization**:

- JWT can also include claims that represent **roles** or **permissions**.
- The server checks these claims to determine what resources or actions the user is **authorized** to access.

  Example JWT payload with roles:

  ```json
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "admin",
    "iat": 1516239022
  }
  ```

In this case, the role claim can be used to authorize the user for administrative actions.

---

#### **6. Token Expiry and Refresh Tokens**

- **Short-Lived JWTs**: JWTs often have short lifetimes (e.g., 15 minutes) to limit risks if they are stolen.
- **Refresh Tokens**: To maintain the user session, a **refresh token** is issued alongside the JWT. When the JWT expires, the client uses the refresh token to obtain a new JWT.

  **Example Flow for Refresh Tokens**:

  - Client sends the refresh token to the server.
  - Server validates the refresh token and returns a new JWT.

---

### **How JWT is Secured**

1. **Signature Verification**:

   - The JWT signature ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with. If the server detects any changes to the token, it will reject it.

   **Signing Algorithms**:

   - Symmetric: HMAC (e.g., `HS256`), using a shared secret.
   - Asymmetric: RSA (e.g., `RS256`), using a private/public key pair.

2. **HTTPS**:

   - JWTs should be transmitted over **HTTPS** to prevent eavesdropping and MITM attacks.

3. **Expiration Claims**:
   - The `exp` claim ensures tokens are only valid for a limited time.

---

### **Summary**

- **JWT Creation**: Server generates a JWT after user authentication.
- **JWT Storage**: Client stores the token and sends it with each request to protected resources.
- **Token Validation**: Server validates the token and grants or denies access based on the token’s validity.
- **Stateless**: JWTs are **stateless**, meaning the server doesn’t need to maintain session data.

JWTs are widely used in **modern web applications** for both **authentication** (verifying identity) and **authorization** (controlling access based on roles or permissions). They enable **stateless, secure communication** between the client and server.
